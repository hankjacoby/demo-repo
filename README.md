# Git & GitHub Guide for Our Team

Welcome to our Git learning environment! This guide will help you understand how to use Git and GitHub to contribute to our project smoothly and confidently.

## Repositories Overview

- **demo-repo (sandbox):** Practice Git commands, make mistakes, and learn safely.
- **(unsure of name rn):** Our real project. All meaningful contributions will go here once you're comfortable.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Git
The link below should guide you on how to download Git on your computer if you need to, no matter the OS.

### 2. Sign up in GitHub

If you do not already have a GitHub account, please create one. Purdue or IU emails should allow for
better resources, however projects will be lost when
students no longer have access to those accounts if
they are not backed up with another email address.

### 3. Download VSCode (optional)

Downloading VSCode or any other IDE is not required,
you could technically only use the website or VIM, 
but I'd recommend downloading an IDE and connecting
your GitHub account to that IDE, for debugging and
linter purposes. This tutorial will also be written 
mostly for people using VSCode instead of another 
IDE or the HTTPS version.
