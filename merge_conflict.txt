This task will help you experience what a Git merge conflict looks like â€” and how to resolve it.

Steps:

1. Make sure your local repo is up to date:
    git checkout main
    git pull

2. Create a new branch:
    git checkout -b your-name-conflict

3. In this file, change the line below to something new.

    > Original sentence:  
    > "This sentence has been changed again in main to create a conflict."

4. Save, then commit and push:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Edit line for conflict practice"
    git push origin your-name-conflict

5. Go to GitHub and open a pull request.

-----------------------------
STOP! Before Merging...
-----------------------------

6. Now switch back to main:
    git checkout main

7. Edit the SAME line to something DIFFERENT, then save and commit:
    git add merge_conflict.txt
    git commit -m "Change same line on main"

8. Pull just in case:
    git pull

-----------------------------
MERGE & RESOLVE
-----------------------------

9. Return to the pull request and try to merge.
    > You should see a merge conflict!
