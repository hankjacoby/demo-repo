This exercise is the first step in learning how to use Git and GitHub
At this point, the repository should be cloned and ready to work with

Steps: 

1. Add your name to a list of names at the bottom of this file below the Steps

2l Hit Ctrl + S to save the file in VSCode

3. Run these commands in the VSCode terminal

    git add .   -> this stages all the changes made for commit
    git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"   -> this saves the changes ready to be added
    git push origin main    -> pushes the changes to GitHub main branch for all to see

4. Reload the GitHub page to make sure your changes are reflected on the website

Useful Tip: 

Add -u to the last command to set origin main as the upstream, meaning future push commands
won't have to specify main as the location if thats intended

It would look like

git push -u origin main
